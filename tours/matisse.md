shape, and balance. Spanning six decades of Matisse’s prolific career, with an emphasis on
the artist’s earliest works, this special exhibition features 50 works
of painting and sculpture, 30 prints, and the artist’s book Jazz.

Get more from your visit with this insightful 13-stop exhibition audio
guide. The tour is in numerical order, but you can listen to the stops
in any order. Many of the works have more than one audio stop that
provides additional layers of information.
